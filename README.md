# Tutorials

Materials from various workshops. 
While these tutorials use NF data in some way, the basic ones are developed with adaptation in mind: aiming for tutorials that can be retailored to another Synapse project/dataset with maybe only 5-20% code modification. 
But there may be highly-differentiated and advanced tutorials that are less reworkable. 

Each directory contains a README with more details about the workshop concept.
